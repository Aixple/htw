The database has 19 tabels from which only one is important for us: state_report .
It is designed so that every row is an update meaning that it could be any device.
Therefore, in order to get the last update of OUR machine, we need to include LIMIT operator
to get the latest result. Machines are called as tools in the table.

/*
	A SQL query to get all the columns about the tool (machine) from the latest update.
*/

SELECT * FROM public.state_report						// state_report is our table
WHERE tool = 'ALN1001' ORDER BY date DESC				// tool is our machine, date is ordered desc to get
														// the latest row
LIMIT 1													// get only the first row/result



/*
	A SQL query to get ONLY the STATE of the MACHINE (this is probably something we will be using to get the state)
*/
SELECT state FROM public.state_report
WHERE tool = 'ALN1001' ORDER BY date DESC				// replace ALN1001 with our preferred machine name
LIMIT 1
